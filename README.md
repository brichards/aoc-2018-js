# Advent of Code 2018

After learning about [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) I couldn't help but participate.

This repo is one where I am experimenting with vanilla JS solutions to each of the daily problems. I'm participating out in the open because this is a learning experience and I like to share those. I hope you'll join me in the fun!

# Repo Organization

Each JS file is named for the puzzle number (01-50) and puzzle name.
